IN V1.1 :)
I will fix "HOW TO PLAY BUTTON"
I will fix  left leaned color pallet,player 2 scoreboard and "HOW TO PLAY BUTTON" button.
Players will be able to adjust game's final score.
When one player reach to the final score, there is no more needed to press hold button for this player.
I will add scroll button for scoreboard.
